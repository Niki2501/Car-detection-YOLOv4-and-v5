# Car-Detection-Using-YOLOv4-YOLOv5

I got a dataset called "Car" from Kaggle, and it has about 1000 images. It only has a class called cars. This dataset was trained using YOLOv4 and YOLOv5, respectively. Both models are capable of detection. nonetheless, YOLOv4 is far superior to YOLOv5. Here is the dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sshikamaru/car-object-detection


# *Library*
Python
Numpy
matplotlib
Open-Cv
Streamlit
YOLOV5
torch
IPython
pathlib



# *Tools*
Google Colab
Visual Studio



# **Deployment**
I utilised streamlit for deployment and took the following actions: -
1. Make a folder.
2. Create a file called requirements.txt, then add all of the necessary library information to it.
3.In this folder, create a virtual environment. Observe these Steps -
4.In VS Code, open the command prompt. Type (python -m venv VE name) and press Enter.
5.The next step is to activate this virtual environment. To do so, type (VE nameScriptsactivate) and press Enter.
6. After activating your virtual environment, install all of the libraries that are necessary for building this programme.
7.After that, create the code for the streamlit app in a Python file.
8. To run this code, use the command streamlit run python file name.py on the command prompt.
